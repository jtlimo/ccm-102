abstract = {This paper presents a framework to handle threats for UAS operating in
the U-space. During UAS operations, unexpected events or threats can happen and
put the UAS in danger. In order to handle those situations, we propose a module for
threats management that incorporates autonomous decision-making capabilities
and is integrated with the U-space. First, we survey related works and compile a
classification of event classes as well as possible contingency or emergency
procedures. Then, we devise an approach to integrate our decision-making
procedure within the U-space framework. This approach selects the proposed
mitigation actions depending on the operational state of the UAS involved. Our
framework takes a step forward in the integration of autonomous systems in the U
space, as there is no current solution for emergency management without the
intervention of UAS operators.},

abstract = {Recently, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have become heavily reliant
on communication, navigation, and other critical components such as sensors and
actuators, which are essential for operations in both civilian and defense
applications. However, this increasing reliance makes UAS more vulnerable to
attacks and faults, posing rising threats. While there have been many advances in
UAS security, a significant number of studies have proposed artificial intelligence
(AI)-enhanced solutions to address these challenges. Yet, no research has explored
the potential of generative AI (GenAI) in this domain. GenAI stands out due to its
ability to detect and prevent cyberattacks by continuously learning and adapting to
new threats and vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose DroneDefGANt, a GenAI
based approach that combines the capabilities of generative adversarial networks
(GAN) and transformer models. The DroneDefGANt is designed to detect both
external UAS attacks like GPS spoofing and jamming, and internal attacks such as
actuator faults. Through evaluations using synthetic datasets, DroneDefGANt
surpassed various conventional AI models, demonstrating superior accuracy and
robustness, particularly in the presence of Gaussian noise.},

Traditional methods for detecting GPS spoofing often fall short in addressing
sophisticated spoofing attacks. In our work, we investigate the application of
machine learning techniques to enhance the detection of GPS spoofing. We aim to
identify patterns and anomalies in GPS signals that indicate spoofing attempts by
leveraging data-driven approaches. Our proposed method involves training machine
learning models on a dataset comprising both legitimate and spoofed GPS signals.
The results obtained from this work demonstrate the effectiveness of these models
in accurately detecting spoofing incidents, particularly with t he tree-based machine
learning model XGBoost. This research underscores the potential of machine
learning to provide robust, real-time spoofing detection, thereby enhancing the
resilience of GPS-dependent systems against malicious attacks, with XGBoost
standing out for its high accuracy.},

scenarios, authentic sets of GPS signal features are collected, followed by other sets
obtained while the UAV is under spoofing attacks launched with a software-defined
radio (SDR) transceiver module. All sets are standardized, analyzed for correlation,
and reduced according to feature importance prior to their exploitation in training,
validating, and testing different multiclass ML classifiers. The resulting performance
evaluation of these classifiers shows a detection rate (DR), misdetection rate (MDR),
and false alarm rate (FAR) better than 92\%, 13\%, and 4\%, respectively, together
with a sub-millisecond detection time. Hence, the proposed modeling facilitates
accurate real-time GPS spoofing detection and classification for UAV applications.},

abstract = {As a malicious attack targeting on the GPS receiver, GPS spoofing attack
interferes the normal received satellite signal by reproducing or relaying the signal,
resulting in severe position deviation. Such attack has posed significant security
threat to unmanned-aerial-vehicles (UAVs), especially in the era of lowaltitude
economics. However, due to the similarity of the spoofing and intended signal, and
the presence of noise, accurate detection and recognition of GPS spoofing attack
still remains a challenging issue, particularly in the case of limited samples. In this
article, we apply the AdaBoost-CNN algorithm, which combines multiple weakconvolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers into a strong classification model, to
achieve GPS spoofing attack recognition. To further improve the recognition
accuracy when there are very limited samples, we improve the AdaBoost-CNN
algorithm by transferring previous network parameters to subsequent CNN. Both
simulated and real measurement data are employed to verify the effectiveness of
the proposed scheme. It is shown that the recognition accuracy can reach up to
93.75\% and 95.83\% with 160 simulated samples and 120 measured samples,
respectively.},

abstract = {To facilitate navigation and tracking, UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) or
drones rely on the global positioning system (GPS). Still, unmanned aerial vehicles
are resistless to GPS spoofing attacks, which involve manipulating GPS module
receivers by transmitting altered signals. For example, an adversary using an adverse
GPS simulator could broadcast counterfeit GPS signals, causing a GPS-reliant UAV to
deviate from its intended flight path. This can result in loss of position accuracy and
potentially cause a crash or unauthorized access to restricted areas. To mitigate this
issue, several approaches have been advocated to detect GPS spoofing attacks.
Motion Processing Units (MPUs) have emerged as a promising option, as they canprovide precise measurements of the UAVs orientation and movement, enabling the
mitigation and detection of spoofing attacks on GPS signals. In this study, a
technique is introduced for identifying and counteracting GPS spoofing attacks in
drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using data from the MPU9250. The
approach employs data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer
along all three axes to detect instances of GPS spoofing and recover accurate GPS
coordinates. Any noteworthy divergence in the gyroscope readings is considered as a
possible GPS spoofing attack. To evaluate the efficacy of the propounded method, it
is tested using real-world experiments, which demonstrate its capability to
successfully detect falsified GPS signals.},

applications is increased in recent years. These UAVs are generally equipped with a
set of sensors and follow a predefined trajectory. The regions of deployment are
usually hostile environments and inaccessible such as disaster zone or military fields.
Therefore, to accomplish their mission, the UAVs need to communicate with each
other, with the Ground Control Station (GCS) and with the navigation satellite
system. Through these infrastructures, the UAVs are prone and vulnerable to various
cyber-attacks such as GPS spoofing. This attack can be launched easily by anattacker using a simple transmitter by broadcasting fake and wrong GPS signals.
These signals can mislead UAVs that receive them from their initial trajectory. In
order to ensure the predefined UAV's mission, detecting GPS spoofing attacks is a
real challenge and permits to get a high level of flight security, high reliability, and
schedule maintenance in time. In this research, we model this issue using a Bayesian
network in order to detect this type of attack, and then, the model analyzes and
detects the fake GPS signal data. The preliminary results that our proposal provides

consistency of GPS measurements when compared to other sensors available, such
